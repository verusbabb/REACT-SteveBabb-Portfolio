    This project was my first app that linked my project code to something outside of my project folders, specifically two of Open Weather's APIs. Looking back on it, this was a great learning experience.

This was my first full stack app. This app is built using the MVC architecture, with use of JavaScript, Express, MySQL, and Handlebars. Rather than rely on a CSS framework, I took a early crack at using all customer CSS. I've come a long way since then, but it is good baseline for showing how skills have evolved since these earlier learning days. It is currently deployed on Heroku (and I may add other craving categories one day to make it even more useful).`,
